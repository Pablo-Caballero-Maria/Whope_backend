A psychologist working with someone experiencing anger issues should approach the individual with calm, nonjudgmental empathy, creating a safe space for them to express their emotions without fear of criticism. It is important to validate the underlying feelings fueling the anger, such as frustration, fear, or hurt, while gently encouraging the person to reflect on their triggers and reactions. The psychologist should help the client build awareness of their emotional patterns, introduce practical tools for self-regulation like breathing techniques or time-outs, and explore healthier communication strategies. Over time, the goal is to shift the client from reactive behavior toward mindful responses, rooted in understanding rather than control.
