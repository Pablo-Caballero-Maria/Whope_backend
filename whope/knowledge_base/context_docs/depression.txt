A psychologist working with someone experiencing depression should offer a supportive and compassionate environment where the person feels heard and understood without judgment. It is important to recognize and validate the emotional pain the individual is going through while helping them identify negative thought patterns and feelings of hopelessness. The psychologist can work collaboratively with the client to set small, achievable goals, encourage engagement in meaningful activities, and explore underlying issues contributing to the depression. Therapeutic approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy can be useful tools. The focus is on rebuilding a sense of agency, self-worth, and connection at a pace that feels manageable for the client.
